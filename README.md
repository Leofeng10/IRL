# Language Imitation via IRL

This repository contains an implementation attempt of the paper <span style="color: #0366d6">["Imitating Language via Scalable Inverse Reinforcement Learning"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01369)</span>.

## Overview

This is an experimental codebase that aims to implement the language imitation approach described in the paper. The implementation uses inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) techniques to learn language models by inferring rewards from expert demonstrations.

## Acknowledgments

The supervised fine-tuning (SFT) code is adapted from <span style="color: #0366d6">[summarize_from_feedback_details](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/summarize_from_feedback_details)</span> repository.

## Notes

This is an experimental implementation and may not fully replicate all aspects of the original paper. Use with caution and expect ongoing changes and improvements.
